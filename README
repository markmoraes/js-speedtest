Web server code and Javascript to do simple network bandwidth/round-trip
timing using a browser to web server.

Use 'make' to compile genrandom, install it in /var/www/cgi-bin/ or wherever
(and under whatever extension/path) your web server prefers CGI programs.
(e.g. some may prefer the executable to be called genrandom.cgi)

Alternatively, if you have a big file (e.g. tar, ISO, mp4) on your web
server already, or on another web server that you want to measure 
bandwidth to, edit speedtest.html with that name.

Copy speedtest.html to the web server and then point your browser at it.
You should see something like:
